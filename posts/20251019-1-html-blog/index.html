that I can totally control everything and simply the process of writing markdown
files and converting them to html files.
However, I found that writing html files directly is not a good idea. The main
reason is

The source format is not friendly. For example, when I paste code snippets,
I have to manually escape special characters like &lt;, &gt;, etc, and the
first line of code snippets must not start from a new line, otherwise an
empty line will be added before the code snippets.
The math equation is not supported well. I have to manually add \( ... \) or
\[ ... \] for inline and block math equations respectively.

So, it is still a good idea to write markdown files and convert them to html
files in the existent workflow.">
