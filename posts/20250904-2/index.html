Well, the central leadership politically is extremely powerful and it&rsquo;s very consolidated. But they hold a very crucial key to the local governments, which is that they decide their fate. Am I gonna promote them? Am I gonna put them in jail? Am I going to fire them? Am I going to reward them? Am I gonna punish them? They hold that crucial key. And I think what was very surprising for most of the Western audience is that when I mentioned about the mayor economy, there&rsquo;s like, why don&rsquo;t our American mayors in each city do these very radical things, and then push for GDP growth, and technology innovation? It&rsquo;s quite different. I think this is where China&rsquo;s very unique in the world, is that political centralization, economic decentralization, and the yardstick to measure local mayor&rsquo;s competence through, in the first stage it was GDP growth. So I am a mayor of the city of Nanjing in Jiangsu province. I&rsquo;m gonna like peak at my neighbor&rsquo;s mayor&rsquo;s city&rsquo;s GDP growth. And I&rsquo;m gonna be very, very competitive. By the way, I forgot about that, competition is extremely competitive among the local government officials because you are competing with other mayor for a top job, right? So you need to do better than them. And whether that was efficient structure or not, I cannot comment, but is certainly just fueled this massive and rapid expansion, economic expansion. First it was industrialization. Everybody wanted to do exports. Then they discovered, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, we can have so much fiscal revenues coming from land, right? Selling land. Let&rsquo;s build real estate and let&rsquo;s urbanize.&rdquo; And then the money kept coming in to these local governments and that they can spend it on nurturing more companies, or supporting real estate, or supporting investment and they can do a better job. So then it was geared towards real estate, and that&rsquo;s how the property cycle became the big thing. Everything was at double speed because of what the local government&rsquo;s incentives were designed to do. I say now that China&rsquo;s biggest challenge is consumption, right? It&rsquo;s not production. We know that China&rsquo;s very, very competitive in production, in supply. China needs to be a consuming country to be a rich country. Why don&rsquo;t you put consumption as part of the yardstick for measuring local governments? For a while it was environmental protection. Guess what? Very few of them really wanna do it seriously, because it goes against the incentives of driving growth, right? They would suffer on GDP growth if they were very serious about environmental protection. So for a couple years, nothing happened in China on that front. And then the central government got really kind of concerned and even angry and frustrated. So they decided to put that as a penalizing factor. And then guess what happened? Well, actually environmental protection sped up. And in the matter of short few years, I see blue skies every day in Beijing. That&rsquo;s how it works.
So GDP is a measure of success in production. What&rsquo;s the measure or what does it mean to be successful on the consumer side? You said it&rsquo;s important to improve that. What does it mean to be a successful consumer nation?
The metrics shouldn&rsquo;t be geared just towards growth alone. GDP growth alone. It was just singular GDP growth, and you can borrow heavily and just spend on infrastructure. That&rsquo;s not a productive way to drive the economy. And that&rsquo;s what the local governments were doing for a long period of time. In the last few years, innovation, unicorns have kind of been an implicit yardstick for local governments. That&rsquo;s kind of how we&rsquo;ve seen these great EV companies, 80 cities doing EVs. I mean, do we really need a 80 cities to do their own EVs, right? Solar panels. Now, DeepSeek has become a star. Semiconductor companies, each local government wants to have their own national champion. So implicitly technology was part of the yardstick competition as well. But if you can more accurately have a metric for consumption measures, really focus on making sure that it&rsquo;s coming from consumption, this GDP growth, rather than from investment or infrastructure, then I think that it might focus the government&rsquo;s objective a bit more on thinking about how to make people feel more secure so that they wanna save more. For instance, creating more jobs, for instance, more on social security spending on healthcare, on elderly care. Because for the longest period of time, this political economy model was brilliant as scaling up supply, but it was extremely weak at raising personal consumption because the incentive does not lie in consumption, it lies in production. So you shift the objectives a little bit, and maybe local government will do more to stimulate consumption.
