why?
When a CPU wants to modify data (not in the &ldquo;Modified&rdquo; or &ldquo;Exclusive&rdquo; state), it will always update the data regardless of the responses from other CPUs.
Thus, the data is immediately updated in the store buffer.
complexity it introduces


Multilayer caches (reason for write memory barrier):

Example: Consider a CPU storing two values (A and B) sequentially, where A is in the store buffer and B is in the cache. It is uncertain whether another CPU will observe the updated A before observing B, as it depends on whether the invalidate message for A is received before the request for B.
Reason: Broadcasting later changes (in the cache) before earlier changes (in the store buffer) are visible to others.



Write memory barrier: CPUs must wait until the store buffer is cleared before applying subsequent changes. Alternatively, later changes can remain in the store buffer until all prior entries in the store buffer have been processed.">
